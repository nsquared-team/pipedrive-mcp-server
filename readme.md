# Pipedrive MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects to the Pipedrive API v2. It allows you to expose Pipedrive data and functionality to LLM applications like Claude.

## Features

- **Read and Write access** to Pipedrive data
- Exposes deals, persons, organizations, and pipelines
- **Create, update, and manage deals** including moving between stages
- **Activity management**: create, update, and mark activities as done
- **Create persons and organizations**
- Includes all fields including custom fields
- Predefined prompts for common operations
- Docker support with multi-stage builds
- JWT authentication support
- Built-in rate limiting for API requests
- Advanced deal filtering (by owner, status, date range, value, etc.)

## Setup

### Standard Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your configuration:
   ```
   PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
   PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN=your-company.pipedrive.com
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Docker Setup

#### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (standalone)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your settings:
   ```bash
   PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
   PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN=your-company.pipedrive.com
   MCP_TRANSPORT=sse  # Use SSE transport for Docker
   MCP_PORT=3000
   ```
2. Build and run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
   - SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/sse`
   - Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`

#### Option 2: Using Pre-built Docker Image

Pull and run the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry:

**For SSE transport (HTTP access):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here \
  -e PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN=your-company.pipedrive.com \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=sse \
  -e MCP_PORT=3000 \
  ghcr.io/juhokoskela/pipedrive-mcp-server:main
```

**For stdio transport (local use):**
```bash
docker run -i \
  -e PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here \
  -e PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN=your-company.pipedrive.com \
  ghcr.io/juhokoskela/pipedrive-mcp-server:main
```

#### Option 3: Integrating into Existing Project

Add the MCP server to your existing application's `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  # Your existing services...

  pipedrive-mcp-server:
    image: ghcr.io/juhokoskela/pipedrive-mcp-server:main
    container_name: pipedrive-mcp-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN=${PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN}
      - PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN=${PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN}
      - MCP_TRANSPORT=sse
      - MCP_PORT=3000
      - PIPEDRIVE_RATE_LIMIT_MIN_TIME_MS=${PIPEDRIVE_RATE_LIMIT_MIN_TIME_MS:-250}
      - PIPEDRIVE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CONCURRENT=${PIPEDRIVE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CONCURRENT:-2}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:3000/health", "||", "exit", "1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

Then add the required environment variables to your `.env` file.

### Environment Variables

Required:
- `PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN` - Your Pipedrive API token
- `PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN` - Your Pipedrive domain (e.g., `your-company.pipedrive.com`)

Optional (JWT Authentication):
- `MCP_JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for authentication
- `MCP_JWT_TOKEN` - JWT token for authentication
- `MCP_JWT_ALGORITHM` - JWT algorithm (default: HS256)
- `MCP_JWT_AUDIENCE` - JWT audience
- `MCP_JWT_ISSUER` - JWT issuer

When JWT authentication is enabled, all SSE requests (`/sse` and the message endpoint) must include an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header signed with the configured secret.

Optional (Rate Limiting):
- `PIPEDRIVE_RATE_LIMIT_MIN_TIME_MS` - Minimum time between requests in milliseconds (default: 250)
- `PIPEDRIVE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CONCURRENT` - Maximum concurrent requests (default: 2)

Optional (Transport Configuration):
- `MCP_TRANSPORT` - Transport type: `stdio` (default, for local use) or `sse` (for Docker/HTTP access)
- `MCP_PORT` - Port for SSE transport (default: 3000, only used when `MCP_TRANSPORT=sse`)
- `MCP_ENDPOINT` - Message endpoint path for SSE (default: /message, only used when `MCP_TRANSPORT=sse`)

## Using with Cline (VS Code Extension)

To use this server with Cline in VS Code:

1. Build the server:
   ```bash
   cd pipedrive-mcp-server
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Add to your Cline MCP settings file (`~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipedrive": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/pipedrive-mcp-server/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token_here",
        "PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN": "your-company.pipedrive.com"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart VS Code or reload the Cline extension
4. The Pipedrive tools will now be available in Cline

### Getting Your Pipedrive Domain

Your Pipedrive domain can be found by:
- Looking at your Pipedrive URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.pipedrive.com`)
- Or querying the API: `curl "https://api.pipedrive.com/v1/users/me?api_token=YOUR_TOKEN"` and check the `company_domain` field

## Using with Claude for Desktop

To use this server with Claude for Desktop:

1. Configure Claude for Desktop by editing your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
